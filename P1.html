    <h1> Designed, engineered and built to be the best driver‚Äôs car in the world.</h1>
    <p>The McLaren F1 redefined the very concept of the supercar when it was launched in 1993. Its spiritual successor, the P1‚Ñ¢, would do the same 20 years later.</p>

     <p>The best-looking cars are the ones with real substance as well as style. The P1‚Ñ¢ is a stunning piece of automotive design, but you won‚Äôt find any needless ornaments or frivolous styling features on it. Every surface has been designed to work, every part given the same aerodynamic consideration as if it was part of an aircraft or a Formula 1‚Ñ¢ car.</p>

            <p>The best-looking cars are the ones with real substance as well as style. The P1‚Ñ¢ is a stunning piece of automotive design, but you won‚Äôt find any needless ornaments or frivolous styling features on it.

            <h4>Innovation</h4>
            <p>The bodywork is ‚Äòshrink-wrapped‚Äô as tightly as possible over the mechanical hard points of the car and the cockpit sits right at the centre. This approach helps to reduce frontal surface area, but also makes it easier to manage airflow over the surface of the bodywork and into the engine‚Äôs roof snorkel intake and to the active aero components. It looks awesome, and it works very efficiently. </p>

            <h4>Lightweight Sport Seats</h4>
            <p>Good wasn‚Äôt good enough for the McLaren P1‚Ñ¢, which is why we produced special lightweight seats with ultra-thin carbon fibre shells. Despite their low-mass construction, they are supremely strong, yet comfortable for longer journeys. The seats are mounted on lightweight brackets and their backs are fixed at an optimum 28-degree angle (although 32 degrees can be specified to increase helmet space). The finished seats weigh just 10.5kg each.</p>

            <h4>Exposed Carbon</h4>
            <p>Carbon fibre doesn‚Äôt just save weight, it can also be beautiful ‚Äì a point proved by the immaculately trimmed interior. The carbon and Alcantara steering wheel has been ergonomically designed, with buttons for the DRS and IPAS systems positioned within easy reach. Instrumentation is displayed on three TFT screens with four switchable modes.</p>

<section class="specs">
    <h1>The numbers behind the P1‚Ñ¢ are astonishing ‚Äì but this isn‚Äôt a car that can be reduced to statistics. It was created to be driven, to deliver extreme performance on road and on track, to be fast, safe and supremely rewarding. The team that created it pushed boundaries and rewrote rules, and the result is a car that puts its driver at the heart of a dynamic experience like no other.</h1>
    <img alt="loading" class="drawing" src="mclaren-p1-engine1.jpeg">
    <p>The mid-mounted twin-turbo V8 engine is derived from the one fitted to the 12C, but with numerous and significant differences. A unique block casting is used to incorporate the IPAS electric motor, and the use of new larger high-pressure turbochargers. By itself, the V8 produces an already astonishing 737PS, but it has been designed to work in conjunction with the electric motor, which gives seamless performance and takes the powertrain‚Äôs combined output to a dizzying 916PS.</p>
